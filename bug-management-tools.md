## üî• Best Practices for Bug Management
Follow these best practices for effective bug tracking:

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Clear Bug Reporting**
- Provide a descriptive **title** and **summary**.
- Include steps to **reproduce the bug**.
- Attach **screenshots, logs, and error messages**.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **Prioritization & Severity Levels**
- **Critical**: Blocks functionality, no workaround available.
- **High**: Major defect, impacts users significantly.
- **Medium**: Minor functionality issues with a workaround.
- **Low**: UI/UX glitches, typos, or cosmetic bugs.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Bug Life Cycle Management**
- **New** ‚Üí **Assigned** ‚Üí **In Progress** ‚Üí **Fixed** ‚Üí **Retested** ‚Üí **Closed**
- Ensure all team members follow the workflow consistently.

### 4Ô∏è‚É£ **Integration with Development & CI/CD**
- Automate bug tracking using tools like **Sentry**, **New Relic**, or **Jira** integrations.
- Link bugs to commits and test cases for better traceability.

### 5Ô∏è‚É£ **Regular Bug Reviews & Grooming**
- Conduct **weekly bug triage meetings**.
- Reprioritize old issues based on business impact.
- Archive irrelevant or duplicate issues.

### 6Ô∏è‚É£ **Automation & AI-Driven Bug Detection**
- Use AI-based tools like **Applitools**, **Testim**, or **Mabl** for visual bug detection.
- Implement log monitoring for proactive bug detection.

### 7Ô∏è‚É£ **Collaboration & Communication**
- Assign the right people to resolve issues promptly.
- Use tags, labels, and filters for quick searching.
- Ensure that all team members have visibility into bug statuses.

## üéØ Bug Management Workflow (Example)
### **1Ô∏è‚É£ Reporting the Bug**
- The tester logs a defect with a detailed description.
- Attach necessary screenshots and log files.

### **2Ô∏è‚É£ Assigning the Bug**
- The bug is assigned to a **developer** based on workload and expertise.

### **3Ô∏è‚É£ Investigation & Fixing**
- Developer analyzes the issue and applies a **fix**.
- Updates the bug status to **Ready for Testing**.

### **4Ô∏è‚É£ Verification by QA**
- The tester retests the fixed issue.
- If resolved, the bug is marked **Closed**.
- If not, the bug is **Reopened** with new observations.

### **5Ô∏è‚É£ Deployment & Regression Testing**
- Fixes are merged into the main branch.
- Regression tests are run to ensure no new bugs are introduced.
